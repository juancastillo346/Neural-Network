# Neural-Network: Hand-Digit-Recognition

<p> This project involves the development of a neural network model using Python to accurately predict handwritten digits. The model is trained on the well-known MNIST dataset, which comprises a vast array of labeled images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.</p>
